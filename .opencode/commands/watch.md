Start the extension in incremental watch mode so esbuild rebuilds automatically on file changes.

Execute: `pnpm run watch` (runs in background — do not wait for it to complete).

Inform the user that watch mode is running and changes to `src/` will trigger automatic rebuilds. To test changes, launch the extension from VS Code using F5 or the "Run ADOExt (Watch)" launch config in `.vscode/launch.json`.
