## 🐛 Feedback & Support

Found a bug or have a feature request? [Open an issue](https://github.com/CompN3rd/ADOExt/issues) on GitHub.

Happy coding! 🎉

1. Open the **Azure DevOps** activity bar icon (sidebar)
2. Click **Sign In** (or the organization icon) to authenticate with your Microsoft account
3. Select your Azure DevOps **organization** from the auto-populated list
4. Select your **project** from the auto-populated list
5. Work items and pull requests will load automatically

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `adoext.organization` | *(empty)* | ADO organization name |
| `adoext.project` | *(empty)* | ADO project name |
| `adoext.organizations` | `[]` | Organizations selected for aggregated views |
| `adoext.projectsByOrganization` | `{}` | Project selections by organization; `["*"]` means all projects |
| `adoext.workItemQueries` | `[]` | Saved work item query definitions. When empty, ADOExt falls back to `adoext.workItemQuery`. |
| `adoext.activeWorkItemQueryId` | `""` | Active saved work item query ID. Falls back to the first saved query or the legacy query setting. |
| `adoext.workItemQuery` | `assigned` | Legacy work item filter used when no saved work item queries are defined. |
| `adoext.workItemHideStates` | `[]` | Work item states to hide from the Work Items tree view (e.g. `["Done", "Removed"]`). Case-insensitive. |
| `adoext.pullRequestQueries` | `[]` | Saved pull request bucket definitions. These are appended below built-in buckets in the Pull Requests view. |
| `adoext.activePullRequestQueryId` | `""` | Legacy pull request query selector state kept for backward compatibility with older versions. |
| `adoext.pullRequestFilter` | `mine` | Legacy pull request filter used as compatibility fallback when older settings are migrated. |
| `adoext.useRemoteWorkItemIcons` | `true` | Prefer Azure DevOps work item type icons (including custom process icons). Disable to force bundled fallback icons. |
| `adoext.planningAssignedFilter` | `all` | Assignee filter for Backlog/Sprint/Board views (`all` or `mine`). |

### Query and bucket management

Use **ADOExt: Select Work Item Query** to switch the active work item preset. In the Pull Requests view, built-in review buckets are always shown (Waiting for My Review, Created by Me, All Open), and **ADOExt: Save Pull Request Query Preset** adds custom buckets to that list. Use the inline refresh action on a bucket to reload only that bucket.

### Hiding work item states

Use the **Toggle Hide Done Work Items** button in the Work Items view title bar (or run **ADOExt: Toggle Hide Done Work Items** from the Command Palette) to quickly add or remove `Done` from `adoext.workItemHideStates`. For finer control, edit the `adoext.workItemHideStates` setting directly to exclude any combination of states (e.g. `["Done", "Removed"]`).

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
# or for watch mode:
npm run watch
npm run watch:webviews
```

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the Extension Development Host.

## MCP Server Integration

ADOExt integrates with the official [Microsoft Azure DevOps MCP server](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp) (`@azure-devops/mcp`), providing a single-install experience with shared configuration. Updates to the official server flow through automatically.

### Quick Setup

Use the **ADOExt: Copy MCP Server Configuration** command to get a ready-to-paste configuration for `.vscode/mcp.json`. The command offers multiple authentication options:

**Interactive (browser-based, default — no PAT needed):**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-devops": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "your-org"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Windows note:** If not using VS Code's native MCP provider (which handles this automatically), replace `"npx"` with `"npx.cmd"` in the command field.

**Bearer token via environment variable (e.g. from ADOExt sign-in session):**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-devops": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "your-org", "--authentication", "envvar"],
      "env": {
        "ADO_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN": "${ADO_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**PAT via environment variable:**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure-devops": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@azure-devops/mcp", "your-org", "--authentication", "pat"],
      "env": {
        "PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

The official Azure DevOps MCP server provides tools across multiple domains:
- **Core** — Projects, teams, iterations
- **Work Items** — Query, create, update work items
- **Work** — Boards, sprints, backlogs
- **Repositories** — Repos, pull requests, branches
- **Pipelines** — Builds, releases
- **Wiki** — Pages, content
- **Search** — Code and work item search
- **Test Plans** — Test suites and results
- **Advanced Security** — Alerts and scanning

Use the `--domains` (`-d`) flag to load only specific domains. See the [official toolset docs](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-mcp/blob/main/docs/TOOLSET.md) for the full list.

### Development Wrapper

For development/testing purposes, the repository includes a wrapper script that bridges environment variables to the official server CLI:

```bash
# Interactive browser-based auth (default, no env vars needed)
npx -y @azure-devops/mcp your-org

# Development wrapper (run from repo after `npm run compile`)
export ADO_ORGANIZATION="your-org"
node out/mcp/main.js                              # interactive (browser)

export ADO_ACCESS_TOKEN="bearer-token-here"       # maps to ADO_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN
node out/mcp/main.js                              # uses --authentication envvar

export AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT="your-pat-here"           # maps to PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
node out/mcp/main.js                              # uses --authentication pat
```

> **Note:** The `node out/mcp/main.js` path is only valid when running from the source repository after compilation. End users should use the `npx @azure-devops/mcp` configurations above.

### Authentication

The MCP server supports multiple authentication methods (checked in order by the wrapper):

1. **Interactive (browser)** — Default. Opens a browser for Microsoft OAuth sign-in. No environment variables needed.
2. **Bearer token** (`ADO_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`) — Pass a bearer token via the `--authentication envvar` method. The wrapper maps `ADO_ACCESS_TOKEN` → `ADO_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`.
3. **PAT** (`PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`) — Personal access token for automation scenarios. The wrapper maps `AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT` → `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

The **ADOExt: Copy MCP Server Configuration** command generates env-var-based configurations that reference `${ADO_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN}` or `${PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}` — tokens are never embedded directly in the config file.
